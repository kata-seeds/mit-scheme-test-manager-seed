# [Kata Seeds]: [MIT/GNU Scheme] + [test-manager]
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kata-seeds/mit-scheme-test-manager-seed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kata-seeds/mit-scheme-test-manager-seed)

[Kata Seeds]: http://kata-seeds.github.io
[MIT/GNU Scheme]: http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/
[test-manager]: https://github.com/axch/test-manager

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and its submodule with `git`:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kata-seeds/mit-scheme-test-manager-seed.git
    cd mit-scheme-test-manager-seed

Install dependencies and run your tests with `make`:

    make

You should eventually see 1 test ran and 0 failures. If `make` doesn't work for you, please open an issue.

You can also run

    make repl

to open the MIT Scheme REPL with your code loaded.

Now you can start your kata! May we suggest the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)?
